<h2 align="center">Deviant - Simple, Extensible Boilerplate/Mini-Framework</h2>

## About Deviant
Deviant is a PHP Boilerplate/mini-framework that has been designed 
from the ground up to be quick and responsive.

## What to Expect
Because this is a newer project, expect that it may not be
mature enough to be used in a production environment.
You'll also notice the lack of documentation, which is being
worked on.

## Requirements
- Minimum of PHP 7.1
- MariaDB or MySQL Server
- Composer

## Installation
Ensure that you have composer installed, clone the repository, and
run `composer install`. To run your project locally, use `composer start`. All of your templates go in 
/app/templates/ and all of your pages go into /app/scripts. Currently
we only support Smarty. If you have any issues, take a loot at some of 
the base project, specifically `/app/controllers/login.php' and its template
'/app/templates/login.tpl'.

You will also need to copy `/env_example` to `/.env` and modify the 
contents to your server configuration. 

Be sure to add any includes to the bootstrap in `/app/bootstrap.php`. This
will defintely change going forward, so make sure to heavily comment.

The schema can be found in /app/database/ - run it on your MySQL Database.

If your permissions get messed up, you can always run 
`/fix_perms.sh`.

## Post Installation
Visit yoursite.com/signup - this will allow you to become an 
administrator. Any registrations that follow will have to be `unlocked`
in the administrator/users menu. Currently any sign-ups have to be approved
by the administrator. This will be a config option going forward,
but for now, its just the way it is.
